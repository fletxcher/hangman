# hangman

A simple hangman game built in C++ that can be played through the command prompt.

# Introduction 
This project was built with the goal of starting a foundation in C++. It follows all of same rules as the original hangman game. 
To get started just download the c++ file and either run it in your IDE or simply open the comman prompt, cd into the directory where you have the file saved, and run "hangman.exe".
